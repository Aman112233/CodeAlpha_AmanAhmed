# **Code Alpha Internship Tasks**  

# 🌸 Task 1: Iris Species Classification  

This first project task contains an **Iris Species Classification System** that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its **sepal and petal measurements**. The model is trained using **machine learning algorithms** to classify flowers into **Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica** species.

## 📌 Features  
- ✅ **Multi-Class Classification** – Identifies whether an Iris flower belongs to Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica species.  
- ✅ **Comparison of Multiple Models** – Evaluates various ML models like **KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks**.  
- ✅ **Cross-Validation** – Uses K-Fold Cross-Validation to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.  
- ✅ **Performance Analysis** – Visualizes model accuracy and helps in selecting the best classifier.
